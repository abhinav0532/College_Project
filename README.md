The lead score prediction project aims to provide businesses with a tool to predict the likelihood of a potential customer becoming a paying customer. By analysing various factors such as demographics, online behaviour, and previous interactions with the business, the lead score prediction model can identify the potential customers who are most likely to convert to paying customers.
